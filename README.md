# Ziggy - Use your Laravel Named Routes inside JavaScript
[ ![Codeship Status for tightenco/ziggy](https://app.codeship.com/projects/fd5f2a10-5f32-0135-294e-56d74613da6d/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/238934)


Ziggy creates a Blade directive which you can include in your views. This will export a JavaScript object of your application's named routes, keyed by their names (aliases), as well as a global `route()` helper function which you can use to access your routes in your JavaScript.

## Installation 

1. Add Ziggy to your Composer file: `composer require tightenco/ziggy`

2. (if Laravel 5.4) Add `Tightenco\Ziggy\ZiggyServiceProvider::class` to the `providers` array in your `config/app.php`.

3. Include our Blade Directive (`@routes`) somewhere in your template before your main application JavaScript is loaded&mdash;likely in the header somewhere.

## Usage

This package replaces the `@routes` directive with a collection of all of your application's routes, keyed by their names. This collection is available at `window.namedRoutes`.

The package also creates an optional `route()` JavaScript helper which functions like Laravel's `route()` PHP helper, which can be used to retrieve URLs by name and (optionally) parameters. 

For example:

`route('posts.index')` should return `posts`

If you wish to retrieve the URL for a route with required parameters, pass a JavaScript object with the parameterss as the second argument to `route()`:

`route('posts.show', {id: 1})` should return `posts/1`

Here's a full example:

```javascript
let postId = 1337;

return axios.get(route('posts.show', {id: postId}))
    .then((response) => {
        return response.data;
    });
```

## Filtering Routes

Filtering routes is *completely* optional. If you want to pass all of your routes to JavaScript by default, you can carry on using Ziggy as described above.

If you do want to filter routes, we have provided two optional configuration settings to allow you to do so. To take advantage of these, create a standard config file called `ziggy.php` in the `config/` directory of your Laravel app and set **either** the `whitelist` or `blacklist` setting to an array of route names.

**Note: You've got to choose one or the other. Setting `whitelist` and `blacklist` will disable filtering altogether and simple return the default list of routes.**

#### Example `config/ziggy.php`
```php
<?php
[
	// 'whitelist' => ['home', 'api.*'],
	'blacklist' => ['admin.*', 'vulnerabilities.*'],
]
```

As shown in the example above, Ziggy the use of asterisks as wildcards in filters. `home` will only match the route named `home` whereas `api.*` will match any route whose name begins with `api.`, such as `api.posts.index` and `api.users.show`.
