# Ziggy - Use your Laravel Named Routes inside JavaScript


Ziggy creates a Blade directive which you can include in your views. This will export a JavaScript object of your application's named routes, keyed by their names (aliases), as well as a global `route()` helper function which you can use to access your routes in your JavaScript.

## Installation

1. Add Ziggy to your Composer file: `composer require tightenco/ziggy`

2. (if Laravel 5.4) Add `Tightenco\Ziggy\ZiggyServiceProvider::class` to the `providers` array in your `config/app.php`.

3. Include our Blade Directive (`@routes`) somewhere in your template before your main application JavaScript is loaded&mdash;likely in the header somewhere.

## Usage

This package replaces the `@routes` directive with a collection of all of your application's routes, keyed by their names. This collection is available at `Ziggy.namedRoutes`.

The package also creates an optional `route()` JavaScript helper which functions like Laravel's `route()` PHP helper, which can be used to retrieve URLs by name and (optionally) parameters.

### Examples:

Without parameters:

```js
route('posts.index') // Returns '/posts'
```

With required parameter:

```js
route('posts.show', {id: 1}) // Returns '/posts/1'
route('posts.show', [1]) // Returns '/posts/1'
route('posts.show', 1) // Returns '/posts/1'
```

With multiple required parameters:

```js
route('events.venues.show', {event: 1, venue: 2}) // Returns '/events/1/venues/2'
route('events.venues.show', [1, 2]) // Returns '/events/1/venues/2'
```

With query parameters:

```js
route('events.venues.show', {event: 1, venue: 2, page: 5, count: 10}) // Returns '/events/1/venues/2?page=5&count=10'
```

If whole objects are passed, Ziggy will automatically look for `id` primary key:

```js
var event = {id: 1, name: 'World Series'};
var venue = {id: 2, name: 'Rogers Centre'};

route('events.venues.show', [event, venue]) // Returns '/events/1/venues/2'
```

If want to use unamed route like
```php
url('/url/want/to/go');
```
Ziggy privide `go` method:
```js
route().go('/url/want/to/go')
```

Practical AJAX example:
```js
var post = {id: 1, title: 'Ziggy Stardust'};

return axios.get(route('posts.show', post))
    .then((response) => {
        return response.data;
    });
```
Ajax | Axios with unamed route
```js
return axios.get(route().go('/url/want/to/go'))
    .then((response) => {
        return response.data;
    });
```
### Default Values
See Laravel [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/urls#default-values)

Default values work out of the box for Laravel versions >= 5.5.29,
for the previous versions you will need to set the default parameters
by including this code somewhere in the same page as our Blade Directive (@routes)
```js
Ziggy.defaultParameters = {
    //example
    locale: "en"
}
```

## Filtering Routes
Filtering routes is *completely* optional. If you want to pass all of your routes to JavaScript by default, you can carry on using Ziggy as described above.

### Basic Whitelisting & Blacklisting
To take advantage of basic whitelisting or blacklisting of routes, you will first need to create a standard config file called `ziggy.php` in the `config/` directory of your Laravel app and set **either** the `whitelist` or `blacklist` setting to an array of route names.

**Note: You've got to choose one or the other. Setting `whitelist` and `blacklist` will disable filtering altogether and simply return the default list of routes.**

#### Example `config/ziggy.php`:
```php
<?php
return [
    // 'whitelist' => ['home', 'api.*'],
    'blacklist' => ['debugbar.*', 'horizon.*', 'admin.*'],
];
```

As shown in the example above, Ziggy the use of asterisks as wildcards in filters. `home` will only match the route named `home` whereas `api.*` will match any route whose name begins with `api.`, such as `api.posts.index` and `api.users.show`.

### Simple Whitelisting & Blacklisting Macros

Whitelisting and blacklisting can also be achieved using the following macros.

#### Example Whitelisting

```php
Route::whitelist(function () {
    Route::get('...')->name('posts');
});

Route::whitelist()->get('...')->name('posts');
```

#### Example Blacklisting

```php
Route::blacklist(function () {
    Route::get('...')->name('posts');
});

Route::blacklist()->get('...')->name('posts');
```

### Advanced Whitelisting Using Groups

You may also optionally define multiple whitelists by defining `groups` in your `config/ziggy.php`:

```php
<?php
return [
    'groups' => [
        'admin' => [
            'admin.*',
            'posts.*',
        ],
        'author' => [
            'posts.*',
        ]
    ],
];
```

In the above example, you can see we have configured multiple whitelists for different user roles.  You may expose a specific whitelist group by passing the group key into `@routes` within your blade view.  Example:

```php
@routes('author')
```
**Note: Using a group will always take precedence over the above mentioned `whitelist` and `blacklist` settings.**

### Other useful methods

#### `current()`
To get the name of the current route (based on the browser's `window.location`) you can use:

```javascript
route().current()
// returns "events.index"
```

To check that we are at a current route, pass the desired route in the only param:

```javascript
route().current("events.index")
// returns true
```

You can even use wildcards:

```javascript
route().current("events.*")
// returns true
```

#### `url()`
Ziggy returns a wrapper of the string primitive, which behaves exactly like a string in almost all cases.
In rare cases where third-party libraries use strict type checking, you may require an actual `String` literal.

To achieve this simple call `.url()` on your route:

```javascript
route('home').url()
// http://myapp.local/
```

## Artisan command

Ziggy publishes an artisan command to generate a `ziggy.js` routes file, which can be used as part of an asset pipeline such as [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/mix).

You can run `php artisan ziggy:generate` in your project to generate a static routes file in `resources/assets/js/ziggy.js`.

Optionally, include a second parameter to override the path and file names (you must pass a file name with the path):

```
php artisan ziggy:generate "resources/foo.js"
```

Example `ziggy.js`, where the named routes `home` and `login` exist in `routes/web.php`:

```php
// routes/web.php

<?php

Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
})->name('home');

Route::get('/login', function () {
    return view('login');
})->name('login');
```

```js
// ziggy.js

var Ziggy = {
    namedRoutes: {"home":{"uri":"\/","methods":["GET","HEAD"],"domain":null},"login":{"uri":"login","methods":["GET","HEAD"],"domain":null}},
    baseUrl: 'http://myapp.local/',
    baseProtocol: 'http',
    baseDomain: 'myapp.local',
    basePort: false
};

export {
    Ziggy
}
```

## Environment-based loading of minified route helper file

When loading the blade helper file, Ziggy will detect the current environment and minify the output if `APP_ENV` is not `local`.

When this happens, `ziggy.min.js` will be loaded. Otherwise, `ziggy.js` will be used.

## Optional `route` helper

If you only want routes available through `@routes`, but don't need the `route` helper function, you can include `skip-route-function` in your config and set it to `true`:

```php
// config/ziggy.php

<?php

return [
    'skip-route-function' => true
];
```

### Using with Vue components

If you want to use the `route` helper within a Vue component, you'll need to add this to your `app.js` file:

```js
Vue.mixin({
    methods: {
        route: route
    }
});
```

Then, use the method in your Vue components like so:

`<a class="nav-link" :href="route('home')">Home</a>`

Thanks to [Archer70](https://github.com/tightenco/ziggy/issues/70#issuecomment-369129032) for this solution.

### Using with `laravel-haml` (and other custom Blade compilers)

[laravel-haml](https://github.com/BKWLD/laravel-haml) provides HAML-based Blade templating. Because laravel-haml uses a separate `BladeCompiler` instance, custom directives (like `@route`) are not automatically imported. There is a [pull request](https://github.com/BKWLD/laravel-haml/pull/25) to fix that. In the mean time, simply place this code in your `./app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`'s `boot()` section:

```php
$customDirectives = $this->app['blade.compiler']->getCustomDirectives();
foreach ($customDirectives as $name => $closure) {
  $this->app['Bkwld\LaravelHaml\HamlBladeCompiler']->directive($name, $closure);
}
```

This pattern is not limited to laravel-haml; it can be used to initialize any custom template compilers you may be using.
