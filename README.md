# Ziggy - Use your Laravel Named Routes inside JavaScript
![TravisCi Status for tightenco/ziggy](https://travis-ci.org/tightenco/ziggy.svg?branch=master)


Ziggy creates a Blade directive which you can include in your views. This will export a JavaScript object of your application's named routes, keyed by their names (aliases), as well as a global `route()` helper function which you can use to access your routes in your JavaScript.

## Installation

1. Add Ziggy to your Composer file: `composer require tightenco/ziggy:"^0.3.0"`

2. (if Laravel 5.4) Add `Tightenco\Ziggy\ZiggyServiceProvider::class` to the `providers` array in your `config/app.php`.

3. Include our Blade Directive (`@routes`) somewhere in your template before your main application JavaScript is loaded&mdash;likely in the header somewhere.

## Usage

This package replaces the `@routes` directive with a collection of all of your application's routes, keyed by their names. This collection is available at `window.namedRoutes`.

The package also creates an optional `route()` JavaScript helper which functions like Laravel's `route()` PHP helper, which can be used to retrieve URLs by name and (optionally) parameters.

### Examples:

Without parameters:

```js
route('posts.index') // Returns '/posts'
```

With required parameter:

```js
route('posts.show', {id: 1}) // Returns '/posts/1'
route('posts.show', [1]) // Returns '/posts/1'
route('posts.show', 1) // Returns '/posts/1'
```

With multiple required parameters:

```js
route('events.venues.show', {event: 1, venue: 2}) // Returns '/events/1/venues/2'
route('events.venues.show', [1, 2]) // Returns '/events/1/venues/2'
```

If whole objects are passed, Ziggy will automatically look for `id` primary key:

```js
var event = {id: 1, name: 'World Series'};
var venue = {id: 2, name: 'Rogers Centre'};

route('events.venues.show', [event, venue]) // Returns '/events/1/venues/2'
```

Practical AJAX example:

```js
var post = {id: 1, title: 'Ziggy Stardust'};

return axios.get(route('posts.show', post))
    .then((response) => {
        return response.data;
    });
```

## Filtering Routes
Filtering routes is *completely* optional. If you want to pass all of your routes to JavaScript by default, you can carry on using Ziggy as described above.

### Basic Whitelisting & Blacklisting
To take advantage of basic whitelisting or blacklisting of routes, you will first need to create a standard config file called `ziggy.php` in the `config/` directory of your Laravel app and set **either** the `whitelist` or `blacklist` setting to an array of route names.

**Note: You've got to choose one or the other. Setting `whitelist` and `blacklist` will disable filtering altogether and simply return the default list of routes.**

#### Example `config/ziggy.php`:
```php
<?php
return [
    // 'whitelist' => ['home', 'api.*'],
    'blacklist' => ['admin.*', 'vulnerabilities.*'],
];
```

As shown in the example above, Ziggy the use of asterisks as wildcards in filters. `home` will only match the route named `home` whereas `api.*` will match any route whose name begins with `api.`, such as `api.posts.index` and `api.users.show`.

### Advanced Whitelisting Using Groups

You may also optionally define multiple whitelists by defining `groups` in your `config/ziggy.php`:

```php
<?php
return [
    'groups' => [
        'admin' => [
            'admin.*',
            'posts.*',
        ],
        'author' => [
            'posts.*',
        ]
    ],
];
```

In the above example, you can see we have configured multiple whitelists for different user roles.  You may expose a specific whitelist group by passing the group key into `@routes` within your blade view.  Example:

```php
@routes('author')
```

**Note: Using a group will always take precedence over the above mentioned `whitelist` and `blacklist` settings.**
