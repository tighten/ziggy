# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Ziggy! Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

To keep things running smoothly we ask you to follow a few guidelines when contributing. Please read and understand this contribution guide before creating an issue or pull request.

## Etiquette

Be kind.

## Viability

If you have an idea for a feature, we'd prefer you open an issue before going to the trouble of writing code. We welcome your ideas, but we'd like to work with you to come up with solutions that work well for the project as a whole. We're usually pretty responsive, so it shouldn't take us long to figure out whether and how best to implement your idea.

## Procedure

Before filing an issue:

- Attempt to replicate the problem, to ensure that it wasn't a coincidence
- Check to make sure your feature suggestion isn't already present within the project
- Check the pull requests tab to ensure that your feature or bugfix isn't already in progress

Before submitting a pull request:

- Check the codebase to ensure that your feature doesn't already exist
- Check the pull requests to ensure that another person hasn't already submitted the feature or fix

## Tests

Please write tests for any fixes or new features you contribute. We use [Orchestra Testbench](http://orchestraplatform.com/docs/latest/components/testbench/) as our base PHPUnit test for PHP and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing our JavaScript.

You can run PHP tests with `vendor/bin/phpunit` and JavaScript tests with `npm test`.

If you need any help with this please don't hesitate to ask.

## Requirements

- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP Code Sniffer](https://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer).
- **Tlint styles** - Tighten-specific styles. Tlint is built for apps, so there are some settings that might not make sense in a package, but [download Tlint](https://github.com/tightenco/tlint) and run it on your pull requests to see if it suggests any reasonable changes.
- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
